Hi! Welcome to my personal website! This website is built based on a Bootstrap template, deployed through Github Pages and requires more updates and maintenance in the future.


# About Me
I am Annie, a third year business and computer science student studying at UBC. I am intrigued by the possibilities bridged by finance and computer science, hence, I recently made an application CryptoConvenient to assist individuals with their digital investments. 

🌎 Originally from Calgary, Alberta<br />
🤓 Tech enthusiast<br />
⭐️ Knowledge in Java, Python, HTML, JS, CSS<br />
📸 Street + Portrait photographer, planning to work with photos I have taken in my next project!
