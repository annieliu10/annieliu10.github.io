Hi! Welcome to my personal website! This website is built based on a Bootstrap template, deployed through Github Pages and requires more updates and maintenance in the future.


# About Me

🌎 Originally from China and moved to Calgary
🤓 Tech enthusiast
⭐️ Knowledge in Java, Python, HTML, JS, CSS
📸 Street + Portrait photographer, planning to work with photos I have taken in my next project!
